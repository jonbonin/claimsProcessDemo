# claimsProcessDemo
This is a demo that a prospective employeer asked me to make/complete in order to asses my HTML/CSS/SASS/JS skills

##Descreption
I started with some mock ups given to me by the prosepective employer. I then converted this into the HTML and SASS languages.

##Requirements
* Convert the diagram represented in the mockups (Photoshop file) to working HTML with corresponding style sheets, images, and JavaScript.
* The HTML should be responsive and look good on all screen sizes
* There should be high fidelity between the working HTML and the original mockups
* There should be some basic Javascript functions to toggle visibility of the “details” section
